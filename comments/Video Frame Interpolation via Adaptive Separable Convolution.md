# [Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Separable Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01692)

**Problem**: The standard approach for video frame interpolation was to compute the optical flow between input frames and then synthesize
an intermediate frame. With convolutional layers, these steps could be united. However, this method is computationally expensive due to large kernels having to be used.

**Solution**:
