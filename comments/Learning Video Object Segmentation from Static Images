**Problem**: Training data for object segmentation within videos is expensive and demanding.

**Solution**: Use input annotations on static images such as bounding boxes and segments. The output of a previous frame is then used as input of the next frame. This is achieved using a novel ConvNet architecture ('MaskTrack').
