# [Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587)

**Problem**: Semantic segmentation of objects at multiple scales is not trivially possible. Solutions to this problem entail 1) the use of exhaustive training data or 2) the use of special architectures. 1) is often prohibitive as multiple scales adds an order of magnitude to dataset size.
