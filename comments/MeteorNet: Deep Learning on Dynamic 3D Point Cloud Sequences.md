# [MeteorNet: Deep Learning on Dynamic 3D Point Cloud Sequences](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Liu_MeteorNet_Deep_Learning_on_Dynamic_3D_Point_Cloud_Sequences_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)

**Problem**: Learning representations for and understanding dynamic 3D point clouds.

**Solution**: The overarching idea is to construct spatiotemporal neighborhoods for each point in the point cloud sequence. 
Information from these neighborhoods is then aggregated to learn features per point.

**Notes**:
* Authors test their method on 3D recognition tasks including action recognition, semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation
