# [Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08408.pdf)

**Problem**: Deep discriminative models have produced stunning results in semantic segmentation tasks. At the same time, 

**Solution**: Train a  [GAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) to produce segmentation maps that are indistinguishable from ground truth segmentation maps (authors argue that this is an attempt similar as self-learning high-order potentials in a CRF).
