# [The Fishyscapes Benchmark: Measuring Blind Spots in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03215.pdf)

**Problem**: CNNs react unpredictably for inputs that deviate from their training distribution. 
In the presence of an outlier object, this is interpolated with available classes, a behaviour similar to what is known in human perception as ‘blind spot’ [11].

**Solution**:  The authors introduce Fishyscapes, a benchmark that evaluates uncertainty estimates for semantic segmentation. The benchmark measures
how well methods detect potentially hazardous anomalies in driving scenes.
