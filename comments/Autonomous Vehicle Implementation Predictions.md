# [Autonomous Vehicle Implementation Predictions](https://www.vtpi.org/avip.pdf)

**Problem**: Autonomous driving will transform mobility in the coming decades. This article approaches implications from the view of city planning.

**Notes**:
* The presumed beneficial effects of fully autonomous driving to society will entail **reduced stress**, **improved productivity and mobility**, **fewer ownership costs** and **better safety**.
* Some of these points are likely too optimistic. For example, improved safety might be mitigated by hardware and software failures, malicious hacking, increased risk-taking (drivers perform increased risk-taking when feeling safe - this is known as risk compensation), platooning risk (platooning means cars driving close together at high speeds to increase throughput) and increased total amounts of vehicles on roads.
* As of now, autonomous driving systems are still unreliable, causing drivers to disengage (i.e. override the control decision of the car). Problems include insufficient space, failing to brake enough at a stop, difficulty detecting vehicles approaching in opposite lanes, problems maintaining GPS signals, software crashes, inability to recognize construction cones, confusion over
unexpected behavior by other drivers, plus other hardware and software problems.
