AREA: VIDEO SEGMENTATION

# [Video Object Segmentation with Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00197.pdf)

**Problem**: Segmenting videos is a hard task - a video typically consists of more than one annotated object, with many distractors, small objects.
and fine structures Most methods trying to mask video frames rely on some sort of temporal continuity to propagate masks. Drifting and large displacements are then hard to handle.

**Solution**: VS-ReID model: mask propagation module (two-stream convolutional neural network) combined with an optical flow module for reidentification

**Notes**: This model won the 2017 DAVID challenge.
