# [EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf)

**Problem**: Object detection has achieved tremendous progress in recent years, but often still involves a trade-off between speed and accuracy. 

**Solution**: The EfficientDet model introduces architecture choices that improve model efficiency by bringing into question well-established ideas such as feature pyramids to both increase accuracy and decrease the number of "uninvolved" network weights.
