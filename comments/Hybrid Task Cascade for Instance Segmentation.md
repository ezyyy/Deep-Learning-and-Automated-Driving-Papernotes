# [Hybrid Task Cascade for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07518.pdf)

**Problem**: *Instance segmentation* is the problem of detecting and delineating each distinct object of interest appearing in an image (and labeling them in a pixel-wise manner, e.g. Person 1, Person 2 etc.). The current state-of-the-art architecture is 
*Cascade architectures* are composed of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds.
