# [ChauffeurNet: Learning to Drive by Imitating the Best and Synthesizing the Worst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03079)

**Problem**: From a very young age onwards, humans are very good at imitating actions of their parents and relatives. Posing this as a robotics challenge by cloning standard driving behavior is a difficult feat even with a perception system for
preprocessing the input (lidar, radar and cameras).

**Solution**: Use [imitation learning](https://blog.statsbot.co/introduction-to-imitation-learning-32334c3b1e7a) (on 30 million driving examples) to train a policy for autonomous driving that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle
