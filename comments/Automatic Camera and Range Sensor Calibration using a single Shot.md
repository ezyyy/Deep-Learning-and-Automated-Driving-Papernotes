# [Automatic Camera and Range Sensor Calibration using a single Shot](http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Geiger2012ICRA.pdf)

**Problem**: Robots are typically equipped with multiple complementary sensors, which require calibration in order to represent
sensed information in a common coordinate system. Hereby,
each sensor can be characterized by its intrinsic (e.g. shape of
the camera lens) and extrinsic (i.e. pose) parameters.
