# [The ML Test Score: A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf)

In this paper summary, I will explain some background in the notes below, so if you are unfamiliar with some terms, there is a good chance it is explained in the *notes* section.

**Problem**: - Creating reliable, production-level machine learning systems brings on a host of concerns not found in
small toy examples or even large offline research experiments.
- To get a ML system ready for production and to reduce its technical debt, testing and monitoring are key considerations. It is, however, unclear how to formulate specific tests.

 **Solution**: - This paper identifies 28 specific tests and monitoring needs, drawn from experience with a wide range of production ML systems to help quantify these issues and present an easy to follow road-map to improve production readiness and pay down ML technical debt.

**Notes**:
* Technical debt is a common computer science metaohor for the possible consequences of poor technical implementation of software. It can very much be compared to monetary debt. If technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement changes later on.
