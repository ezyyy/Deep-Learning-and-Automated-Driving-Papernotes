**Problem**: RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing. Even vanilla deep feedforward NNs achieved better performance.

**Solution**: Combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs.
